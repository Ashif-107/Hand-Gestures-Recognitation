This repository contains the following contents.
* Sample program
* Hand sign recognition model(TFLite)
* Finger gesture recognition model(TFLite)
* Learning data for hand sign recognition and notebook for learning
* Learning data for finger gesture recognition and notebook for learning

# Type of Machine learning 
   Deep Learning Algorithms and Computer Vision technologies are frequently heavily utilized in modern approaches. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is the most widely used method for gesture detection

# My contibution 
* Got the basic Framework from two people whose original file is given below.
  Thanks a lot for those persons. Added new keypoints and new signs.
# Reference
* [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/)
